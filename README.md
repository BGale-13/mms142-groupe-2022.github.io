The project for MMS 140 at the University of the Philippines Open University will focus on discussing the impact of artificial intelligence on the art generation industry. The project will be divided into six parts:

Part 1: Extended Definition of Disruptive Technology
Part 2: What is Artificial Intelligence in Art Generation / How Does it Work
Part 3: Brief History and Current Situation of Artificial Intelligence in Art Generation
Part 4: Why is Artificial Intelligence in Art Generation Disruptive [Positive and Negative]
Part 5: What Field/Market is Artificial Intelligence in Art Generation Disrupting
Part 6: Conclusion [Alternatives?].
In part 1, the project will provide an extended definition of disruptive technology, examining its characteristics and how it differs from other types of technology. In part 2, the project will describe what artificial intelligence in art generation is and how it works, including a discussion of the various algorithms and techniques used.

In part 3, the project will provide a brief history of artificial intelligence in art generation, from its early beginnings to its current state of development. This section will also discuss the current situation of AI in the art industry, including its current uses and limitations.

In part 4, the project will explore the reasons why artificial intelligence in art generation is considered disruptive, both in a positive and negative sense. This section will consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of AI in the art industry, and how it may impact artists and the market as a whole.

In part 5, the project will discuss the specific field or market that AI in art generation is disrupting. This section will consider the impact of AI on traditional art forms, as well as on emerging digital and interactive media.

In the conclusion (part 6), the project will summarize the key points made in the previous sections, and consider any potential alternatives to the use of AI in art generation. This section may also provide recommendations for how the art industry can adapt to the growing use of AI in art generation.
