There is no single event that led to the development of AI art generators. Instead, the development of AI art generators has been the result of a series of technological and conceptual advancements in the field of artificial intelligence. Below is a brief history of AI-generated art from the 1950s to the present day:

1950s: In the mid-1950s, John McCarthy, also recognized as the Father of Artificial Intelligence (AI), coined AI and defined it as the “science and engineering of making intelligent machines” (Artificial Solutions, 2020). But in addition to making human intelligence the standard for improving AI, human creativity was soon added. AI has then been utilized as a medium for creating art for several years. 
One early example of AI-generated art can be traced back to the 1950s when a computer program called "traveling salesperson" was utilized to generate drawings of abstract shapes and lines to produce simple geometric patterns (Scott, 2022). 
The development of the first artificial neural networks in the 1950s provided a computational model for learning and decision-making inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. But at the time, the technology available for creating and running computer programs was limited, resulting in artworks that were still simple. Nevertheless, these early experiments with AI art established the foundation for more sophisticated AI art generators that would be developed in the following decades.
