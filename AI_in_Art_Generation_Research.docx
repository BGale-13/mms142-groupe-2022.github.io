-- Part 2: WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ART GENERATION / HOW DOES IT WORK --

Digital art is continuously growing as our technology evolves quickly, thanks to new inventions and innovations created and discovered in recent times.
One of the most fast-growing and controversial topics is the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically the area of artificial intelligence art or most commonly known as AI art.
According to UNICEF (2021), “AI refers to machine-based systems that can, given a set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions that influence real or virtual environments. 
AI systems interact with us and act on our environment, either directly or indirectly. Often, they appear to operate autonomously, and can adapt their behavior by learning about the context.” 
AI-generated art can include fully autonomous works—in which researchers investigate whether AI can be creative without human intervention—and real-time human-robot collaboration. 
In doing so, they attempt to comprehend human-machine communication. AI is now being fully implemented in various artistic fields, including paintings, poetry, films, and music.


-- Part 3: BRIEF HISTORY AND CURRENT SITUATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ART GENERATION --

There is no single event that led to the development of AI art generators. Instead, the development of AI art generators has been the result of a series of technological and conceptual advancements in the field of artificial intelligence. Below is a brief history of AI-generated art from the 1950s to the present day:

1950s

In the mid-1950s, John McCarthy, also recognized as the Father of Artificial Intelligence (AI), coined AI and defined it as the “science and engineering of making intelligent machines” (Artificial Solutions, 2020). But in addition to making human intelligence the standard for improving AI, human creativity was soon added. AI has then been utilized as a medium for creating art for several years. 

One early example of AI-generated art can be traced back to the 1950s when a computer program called "traveling salesperson" was utilized to generate drawings of abstract shapes and lines to produce simple geometric patterns (Scott, 2022). 

The development of the first artificial neural networks in the 1950s provided a computational model for learning and decision-making inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. But at the time, the technology available for creating and running computer programs was limited, resulting in artworks that were still simple. Nevertheless, these early experiments with AI art established the foundation for more sophisticated AI art generators that would be developed in the following decades. 

1960s to 2000s

The advent of powerful computers in the 1960s allowed researchers to train and evaluate complex artificial neural networks on large datasets.
The ‘60s and ‘70s were the times AI researchers utilized computer programs for creating more complex art, such as drawings of human faces and landscapes. These early AI art generators were restricted by the technology of the time, resulting in art that was often simplistic and lacked subtlety (Anyoha, 2020).
In the 1980s, the introduction of deep learning algorithms enabled artificial neural networks to learn multiple levels of abstraction in data and improve their performance on complex tasks (Yang & Yang, 2014).

During the ‘80s and ‘90s, AI art generators began to evolve, taking advantage of advances in computer hardware and software. These new AI art generators were capable of producing more sophisticated and detailed art, some of which were even exhibited in galleries. A well-known example of AI-generated art in 1999 is the "Electric Sheep screensaver" which employed AI algorithms to generate a sequence of abstract images displayed on computers running the screensaver (Diaz-Aviles, 2019). 

2000s to Present

The availability of large amounts of data and computing power in the 21st century has allowed researchers to train and develop highly advanced AI models that can generate art and other creative outputs. With this came the rise of generative models which are a class of AI algorithms designed to generate new data similar to a given input (Karpathy, 2020). These generative models were used to create a wide range of AI-generated art, including images, music, and even poetry. A notable example of an AI-art generator from the year 2005 is the "Painting Fool" program which utilized AI algorithms to combine elements from different source images and apply different artistic techniques in painting (The Guardian, 2012). 
In recent years, AI art generators have undergone significant advancements, primarily due to the development of deep learning algorithms and the abundance of data. These advancements have enabled them to generate art that is indiscernible from human-created art. Currently, AI art generators are utilized in a diverse range of applications, including the creation of digital paintings and sculptures, as well as the generation of music and writing. 

Current Situation in the Philippines

According to Microsoft Philippines, the year of AI in the country is 2018 (Rosales et al., 2020). During this time, AI was also expected to significantly improve creativity and productivity in the market. When it came to AI and Philippine Literature, one of the known milestones was the introduction of a robot that could photograph people and make them Filipino poems (The Good News Pilipinas Team, 2019). Another type of art AI is often used for is digital art. An example of this was when a small company applied machine learning to produce different artworks with the painting style of the famous painter Fernando Amorsolo in order to commemorate him (Brunich, 2022). There is also another interesting use of AI that generates a digital version of people based on the photos they provide. Popular Filipinos like TV personality Joey Mead King and Chef Miko Aspiras, and photographer or graphic designer Samantha Valenciano shared the AI-created versions of themselves in their social media (Rodrigues, 2022). But besides imitating and combining artworks, AI has also been useful in art restoration. In 2011, a paper was written describing the process of digitally restoring Fernando Amorsolo’s painting named “Malacañang by the River” through a neural network (Palmero & Soriano, 2011). At present, Philippine artists have divided views on AI-generated art. While there are those that see AI as something that can be abused and monopolized in the art industry, there are also others that see it as a fascinating and useful product of technology (de Leon, 2022).
