Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used in the art world over recent years and is continuing to revolutionise traditional methods of artwork creation. AI algorithms can be used to generate unique pieces of art with multiple possibilities and combinations, making it easier to access new and interesting forms of art. AI art generators are able to quickly create distinct visualisations based on a given image or content, allowing for experimentation with composition, color, and form. Deep learning techniques allow for intricate patterns and other artistic elements to be accurately created from these images in minutes, enabling artists to explore unknown creative paths and providing them a platform to craft meaningful works of art.
